  "summary": "The diff shows LeaseOfferEditorDialog now only tracks/validates Listing ID, Lease Code (UUID), and Split Ratio, and it supplies safe defaults for location/area/capacity in the submit payload. However, due to truncation, it’s not fully verifiable that the primary form UI no longer renders Location/Area/Capacity inputs or that no “fill all required fields” validation remains elsewhere in the component.",

      "requirement": "Remove Location, Area, and Capacity from the required validation and from the primary form UI (they may be omitted entirely or moved into an optional/advanced section that is not required to submit).",
      "reason": "The state/validation shown only includes id/code/splitRatio, but the file is truncated before the JSX form fields, so it cannot be confirmed that Location/Area/Capacity inputs were removed (or moved to optional/advanced) from the rendered UI.",
