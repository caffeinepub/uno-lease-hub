# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the “List Your Lease” call-to-action from the Home/Landing page hero section.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Home/Landing page hero CTA row to remove the button/link labeled “List Your Lease”.
- Ensure remaining hero CTA(s) stay visually aligned and responsive on mobile and desktop.

**User-visible outcome:** The Home page no longer offers a “List Your Lease” hero button, while other hero CTAs remain available and properly aligned.
