  "summary": "Plan a custom, mobile-compatible website running on the ICP blockchain for UNO/ULO lease listings and lease-code distribution, using unitynodes.club as UI inspiration but aligning product/content guidance with https://unitynodes.io (Unity mobile app is not ICP-powered). The site should clearly communicate there is a single UNO/admin offering ULO lease codes, and ULO users only browse listings and copy lease codes for use in the Unity App (no additional ULO functionality).",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Target deployment/runtime: ICP blockchain (Internet Computer).",
    "Starting point/reference implementation: https://unitynodes.club to be modified/customized.",
    "Add responsive/mobile-first design requirements for all core flows (public pages + authenticated dashboard).",
    "Content/branding reference source: https://unitynodes.io and its media kit assets.",
    "Product constraint: Only one UNO/admin will offer ULO lease codes; public copy and flows should reflect a single-offer/operator model.",
    "Product constraint: Unity mobile app is not ICP-powered; only this website is deployed on ICP and should avoid implying the Unity leasing service/app runs on ICP.",
    "Product constraint: ULO users only browse listings and copy lease codes for use in the Unity App; no other ULO-facing functions are provided.",
    "Security requirement: Admin/dashboard access should be restricted to an allowlist containing the UNO's Internet Identity principal (single-admin mode).",
    "Home page copy should remove/avoid the \"UnityNodes\" branding/name and the provided headline/UNO section text; keep messaging aligned with the single-UNO, ULO-browse/copy-code scope constraints.",
    "Add public-facing app download CTAs linking to Google Play and Apple App Store (Unity Network App) on relevant pages (e.g., Home and/or How It Works)."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Safety system may block sharing of the user's Internet Identity principal, preventing configuration of single-admin allowlist via chat.",
    "Build/deploy action to 'make the site live' intermittently fails with an error ('AI couldn't process your request successfully').",
    "Draft environment may fail to load some images and YouTube embeds, causing media not to appear in draft previews.",
    "User reports being unable to log in to the site via Internet Identity (II sign-in flow not completing).",
    "Creating a lease listing can fail with \"Actor not available\" error (frontend unable to create authenticated actor / identity not available).",
    "After logging out of the UNO dashboard, newly-updated lease code listings may not appear on the public site (public listings/details rendering issue when only Lease Code + Split Ratio are present).",
    "YouTube video embeds/Shorts section not working (videos do not play/load).",
    "User reports seeing \"Actor not available\" error when attempting to log in (II/authenticated actor creation failing during login flow).",
    "Production shows \"Initialization Error\" (trouble setting up session; suggests refresh) during/after login initialization.",
    "Production shows \"Connection Issue\" / unable to establish connection to backend (possible canister/agent/network failure) alongside initialization error."
